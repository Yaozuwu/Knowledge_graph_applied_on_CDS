# Knowledge_graph_applied_on_CDS

## Clinical decision support systems

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) aim to provide clinicians or patients with computer-generated clinical knowledge and patient-related information that can be intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance patient care.

## Purpose:

Electronic medical records (EMRs) contain an amount of medical knowledge which can be used for clinical decision support (CDS).

Our objective is a system that can extract and represent these knowledge contained in EMRs to support three CDS tasks: 

- Determining a patientâ€™s most likely diagnosis given a list of symptoms
- Deciding on the most effective treatment plan for a patient with a known condition
- Determining if a particular test is indicated for a given situation

with the given condition of one patient.





## Knowledge graph

### Introduction:

Our knowledge graph is divided into two parts, the first consists of public medical knowledge from three databases: Drugbank, GNBR, and Hetionet, and the second consists of data on patients with different diseases extracted from hospital Electronic Medical records(EMR).

| Side Effect | Adverse drug reactions. From [SIDER](http://sideeffects.embl.de/)/[UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/). |
| Atc         | ATC code (Antithrombotic agents) is a drug subgroup of the Anatomical, Therapeutic and Chemical Classification System for Drugs, which is administered by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics. From [DrugBank](https://www.drugbank.ca/). |
| Treatment   | Treatment consists of a number of surgical and nursing acts. From EMR |
| Test        | Test consists of a variety of medical tests. From EMR        |
| Test result | Test result is the test result of the Test and is used to confirm the diagnosis of the corresponding disease. From EMR |
