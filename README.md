# Knowledge_graph_applied_on_CDS

## Clinical decision support systems

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) aim to provide clinicians or patients with computer-generated clinical knowledge and patient-related information that can be intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance patient care.

## Purpose:

Our objective is a system that can extract and represent these knowledge contained in EMRs to support three CDS tasks: 

- Determining a patientâ€™s most likely diagnosis given a list of symptoms
- Deciding on the most effective treatment plan for a patient with a known condition
- Determining if a particular test is indicated for a given situation

with the given condition of one patient.
